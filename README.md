# math-modeling-code-matlab
Example code and simulated data for a mathematical modeling class.  Matlab version.

Covers:
- Curve Fitting (plotting, polyfit, transformed least squares, lsqcurvefit)
- Gradient Ascent/Descent Optimization in 1D & 2D
- Simulating Randomness: a fair or unfair coin/die
- Monte Carlo Simulations (several)
- Iterating a Difference Equation
- Euler's Method and ode45: implementation and direct comparison
